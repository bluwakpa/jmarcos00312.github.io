                            <h3> Intro</h3>
                            <p class="intro">I started learning how to code around August of 2020. I am currently located in Temple, Texas, but willing to move for work. I am originally from the Philippines. When I was 12 years old I moved to Barbados and stayed there for two years. I came to The United states nine years ago. In 2019 I got a job as a dialysis technician and worked there for 18 months while I was studying for a nursing degree. However, I realized that nursing was not for me and decided to pursue a  career in software engineering. I am currently in the Thinkful Software Engineer Immerssion course. </p>

                            <h4 class="about-me"> I  enjoy the challenges that come with coding, I love to solve problems and help  other people when they get stuck on a coding problem. I try to help as much as I can and I am willing to take criticism for my work. I enjoy team work and collaboration. </h4>
